## About The Project

![Screen Shot](public/images/Screenshot.png)

Meowsletter! A newsletter project built with React and powered by LOVE ðŸ«¶!

## Built With

The user interface of Meowsletter is built with React, Typescript, Styled Components, and Lottie Animations, providing a smooth and responsive experience for viewers. The React components are organized and optimized for optimal performance, making the newsletter fast and user-friendly.

AI
The challenge involves using a personal interest in design while utilizing AI to generate photos that add uniquness and creativity to the project.

Fun and Creative Name
Meowsletter wasn't just a technical challenge for me, it was also a fun and creative project. The name itself, "Meowsletter", adds a touch of playfulness to the project, hopefully, making it a standout among the participants of this challenge.
